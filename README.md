## Introduction
This project is the nineteenth coding module challenge that we had to complete as part of the Denver University AI Bootcamp coursework. 

The initial code provided for the challenge had us work with a CSV file that included metadata / features for a unamed organization and the employees career profile. The task was to build out a recommendation engine using neural network that would be trained on this rich meta data. The neural network model was built, complied, to identify the accuracy of the model to predict employee's possible attrition from the organization. 


## Installation Requirements
*Requirements*: You must run Python 3.12.7 to execute the code as the code uses match case sytax that is older versions of python will not recognize.

## Usage
For Human Resources Departments that can use employee data to predict attrition within their organization using a neural network.

## License
I've included the MIT License to encourage collaboration and use by the community.

## Acknowledgement / Contributing
Thank to the guidance of the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant's and their hints via comments that helped me complete this assignment. Without this I would've been completely lost. 

While a section of this code was written by the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant, it has been modified / completed by me.
